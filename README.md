This is a public repository to share and store robotics programs for reference, learning and innovation.  

To view the files and programs, you will need to install the Lego Mindstorms for Education.  

These programs were created with the assumption that the files would be run using our "Llama" robot built by the team using the Lego Mindstorms EV3 system.  

The robot followed no set instructions and was a result of the team's ideas in order to solve the problems on the "RePLAY" board used in the 2020-2021 First Lego League robotics challenge.
